## 🚨 BIGGEST RISKS (Plan For These Now)

### Risk 1: Teacher Adoption
**Problem:** Teachers download but don't use daily

**Solution:** 
- Onboarding calls (1-on-1 with first 50)
- In-app tutorials
- Habit building (send 3:30pm homework reminder)

**Success Metric:** >50% filling diary 2x/week

---

### Risk 2: Parent Engagement
**Problem:** Teachers fill diary but parents don't see it

**Solution:**
- Push notifications (SMS to non-active parents)
- Email digest (weekly homework summary)
- School integration (school recommends)

**Success Metric:** >60% of parents signing daily/weekly

---

### Risk 3: Competition
**Problem:** Large company copies you

**Solution:**
- Move fast (1,000+ users before they enter)
- Get contracts (sticky customer lock-in)
- Build network effects (teachers ↔ parents)

**Success Metric:** 1,000+ paying customers by Month 12

---

## 💰 UNIT ECONOMICS (Make or Break)

### The Math (Teacher Tier Only)

```
CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): $10-20
LTV (Customer Lifetime Value): $100-200
LTV:CAC Ratio: 5-10:1 ✓ (Healthy is >3:1)

Monthly Churn: 5% (95% retention)
Avg Customer Lifetime: 20 months
Revenue per Customer: $6/month × 20 = $120

With 1,000 customers:
- Monthly Revenue: $6,000
- Monthly Costs: $2,000 (infra + team)
- Gross Margin: 66% ✓
- Runway: 18+ months if bootstrapping
```

**This is healthy.** Once you prove this works at scale, raising money is easy.

## 🎬 THE NARRATIVE (Tell This to Teachers, Investors, Partners)

*We're currently proving product-market fit with teachers in Nairobi and have strong interest from school networks across Kenya. Our goal: make homework tracking effortless so teachers can focus on teaching and parents can stay involved."*
