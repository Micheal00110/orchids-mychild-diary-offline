## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Feedback Request (Send to 50 Teachers)

**Subject:** Help me improve MyChild Diary - 2 min survey (+ $5 airtime for your help)

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I'm building MyChild Diary - a free app that digitizes school homework tracking.

You fill subject + homework + notes → Parents see it instantly on their phones.

Teachers I've talked to say it saves them ~5 hours/week.

Would you be open to testing it + giving feedback?

I'll send you $5 airtime as a thank you for 2 mins of feedback.

Just reply "Yes" and I'll send the link + survey.

Thanks,
[Your name]

P.S. - Works offline, so no internet needed during school hours. Data syncs when you get connectivity.
```

### Template 2: Direct Sales (Send to School Heads)

**Subject:** Free homework tracking for [School Name]'s teachers

**Body:**
```
Hi [Head of School Name],

I spoke with [Teacher Name] from your school about homework tracking challenges.

She mentioned:
- Paper diaries getting lost
- Parents not seeing homework
- No records of what was taught

We built MyChild Diary to solve this.

It's simple: Teachers enter homework once → Parents see it instantly → No more missing homework.

I'd love to show you 10-min demo of how it works.

Would [Day/Time] work for a quick call?

[Phone]

### Template 3: Partnership Outreach

**Subject:** Partnership: Featured in [Community] Newsletter

**Body:**
```
Hi [Partner Name],

I love what [Community/Organization] is doing for teachers in Kenya.

We just launched MyChild Diary - a free app that helps teachers manage homework digitally (real-time sync, parent signatures, 2-way chat).

We're getting good traction (500+ beta users) and helping teachers save 5 hours/week.

Would [Community] be interested in featuring us in your next newsletter?

We can provide:
- 30-second explainer video
- 3 sample quotes from teacher users
- Special link for your members (we'll give them 1 month free)

Let me know if you're interested!

## 🎯 NORTH STAR METRIC

**Pick ONE metric to obsess over (until you hit it):**

### Option 1: User Growth
**Obsess:** Reach 500 active teachers by end of March
**Daily:** Log in, see how many active users today

### Option 2: Revenue
**Obsess:** Get first $1k in monthly recurring revenue by June
**Daily:** Track who's paying, who's about to convert

### Option 3: Product-Market Fit
**Obsess:** Reach 70%+ NPS score by May
**Daily:** Ask every user "How likely are you to recommend (0-10)?"

**I recommend:** Start with **User Growth** (Feb-Apr), then pivot to **Revenue** (May+).

This is how most successful apps scale: get to 1,000 free users, then convert 5-10% to paid.

## 💪 MINDSET REMINDERS

When you get tired (and you will):

1. **Rejection is OK** - Most people will say no. That's normal. 10% say yes = success.

2. **Speed over perfection** - Ship v0.9, get feedback, iterate. Don't wait for perfect.

3. **Talk to users constantly** - Spend 50% of your time talking to teachers. They'll tell you exactly what to build next.

4. **Build for one person deeply** - Don't try to appeal to everyone. Build for one teacher so well that they can't live without it.

5. **Revenue changes everything** - First paying customer will motivate you more than 1,000 free signups.
