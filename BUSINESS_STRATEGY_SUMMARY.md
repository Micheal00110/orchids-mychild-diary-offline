- **You:** Everything (product, marketing, sales)
- **Advisors:** Unfilled (find 2-3 mentors)
- **Cost:** $0

### Month 4 (May 2026)
- **You:** Still everything, but focusing on sales
- **Hire:** 1 part-time developer ($200-400/month)
- **Cost:** $2,500-5,000/year

### Month 8 (September 2026)

## 🚀 KEY DECISION POINTS

### Decision 1: Revenue Model (DECIDE THIS MONTH)
**Options:**
- A) Freemium (our recommendation) ← Pick this
- B) B2B2C only
- C) School plans only

**Why Freemium:** Fastest path to 10,000 users → proves traction → easier to raise money later → best TAM expansion.

---

### Decision 2: Geographic Focus (DECIDE THIS MONTH)
**Options:**
- A) Kenya only (Month 1-6) ← Pick this
- B) Start with Uganda + Tanzania simultaneously
- C) Skip to Nigeria

**Why Kenya first:** Easiest market to distribute (local connections) → test all channels → then scale regionally.

---

### Decision 3: Hiring Timeline (DECIDE NEXT MONTH)
**Options:**
- A) Stay solo until $5k MRR (May 2026)
- B) Hire first dev by March (Month 1)
- C) Hire sales person instead of dev

**Why (A):** You're still figuring out product. More hands ≠ faster learning. Once you have PMF, hiring accelerates growth.

---

### Decision 4: Fundraising (DECIDE MONTH 6)
**Options:**
- A) Bootstrap through $25k MRR (your target by Dec)
- B) Raise $50k angel round at Month 6
- C) Apply to accelerators (Y Combinator, etc)

**Why wait:** Prove unit economics first. $25k MRR by Month 12 = startup you can raise at good valuation.

## ⚠️ BIGGEST RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Teacher Adoption (Biggest Risk)
**Risk:** Teachers like the app but don't actually use it daily

**Mitigation:**
1. Onboarding calls (1-on-1 with first 50 users)
2. In-app tutorials (reduce time to first diary entry)
3. Habit building (send reminders at 3:30pm - homework time)
4. Gamification (streak counter - "20 days filling homework")

**Metric:** >50% of teachers filling diary at least 2x/week

---

### Risk 2: Parent Engagement (Second Biggest Risk)
**Risk:** Teachers fill diary but parents don't read it

**Mitigation:**
1. Push notifications (SMS for non-active parents)
2. Email digest ("Weekly homework for your child")
3. School integration (school sends your link in newsletter)
4. Gamification (parents get badge for "Work Ensured" 20 times)

**Metric:** >60% of parents signing daily/weekly

---

### Risk 3: Competition (Will Happen)
**Risk:** Larger ed-tech company copies you

**Mitigation:**
1. Move fast (get 10,000 users before they enter)
2. Build network effects (teacher → parent → school)
3. Get school contracts (sticky, hard to leave)
4. Build moat (partnerships, integrations)

**Metric:** 1,000+ paying customers by Month 12 (sticky base)

---

### Risk 4: Unit Economics (Financial Risk)
**Risk:** CAC too high, LTV too low = unsustainable

**Mitigation:**
1. Reduce CAC through organic (don't spend on ads until Month 4)
2. Increase LTV through upsells (free → $6 → school plan)
3. Focus on retention (>70% retention = sustainable)
4. Monitor monthly (create dashboard, update every Friday)

**Metric:** CAC < $20, LTV > $100 (5:1 LTV:CAC ratio)

## 📞 SUPPORT NETWORK (Build This Month)

**Find 3 people to advise you (free, equity-based):**

1. **EdTech Advisor** - Someone who's built ed apps
   - **What they do:** Advise on product, user acquisition, pitfalls
   - **Where to find:** LinkedIn (search "EdTech founder Kenya"), iHub mentors
   - **Ask:** "Would you mentor me for 1 hour/month? I'd give you 0.5% equity."

2. **Sales Advisor** - Someone with B2B sales experience
   - **What they do:** Help close first school deals, refine sales process
   - **Where to find:** Local entrepreneurs, corporate sales people
   - **Ask:** "I'm building a school app. Could I pick your brain on sales strategy?"

3. **Scaling Advisor** - Someone who's scaled a startup
   - **What they do:** Help plan hiring, fundraising, scaling strategy
   - **Where to find:** Successful founders (AngelList, LinkedIn)
   - **Ask:** "I'm at 500 users and need advice on scaling. Could we grab coffee?"

**Why this matters:** They've made mistakes. You'll learn from them instead of repeating them.

## 🎉 FINAL THOUGHTS

You've built something teachers genuinely need.

The market is massive (40k schools in East Africa, 300k in Africa, millions globally).

The unit economics work ($6/month from teachers, $100/month from schools).

Your window to move fast is NOW (before competition).

---

### The Next 30 Days Determine Everything

Spend the next month validating 3 things:

1. **Teachers will actually use it** (collect 10+ daily active teachers)
2. **Parents will engage** (parents signing 50%+ of diary entries)
3. **Schools will pay** (close 1 pilot school by March 31)

If you hit these 3 metrics by March 31 → You've got a business.

Then it's just a matter of scaling.

---

### Your Unfair Advantages

1. ✅ Built the product yourself (understand it deeply)
2. ✅ Local founder (understand Kenya market)
3. ✅ Beautiful design (teachers will evangelize)
4. ✅ Real problem (not solving imaginary pain)
5. ✅ First mover (no real competitor yet)

**These advantages disappear over time.** Use them NOW.

---

### What to Do Next

Pick ONE thing from this list:
- [ ] Direct sales (email 50 school heads)
- [ ] Content marketing (write 3 blog posts)
- [ ] Partnerships (call 10 potential partners)

Do that thing for the next 30 days.

Then measure if it's working.

If yes → double down.  
If no → pivot to next thing.

Speed + learning beats perfect planning.

---

**You've got this. 💪**

**Go make teachers love your app.**

**Then make schools pay for it.**

**Then expand the world.**
